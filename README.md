# Password Manager

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.0.0.

To run this project first restful-web-service must be run as a java application - I used eclipse to do this. Then 'ng serve' must be run in the password-manager directory. After that navigate to localhost:4200. the username is daniel and the password is dummy
